## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

<img style="float: left;" src="ninde/readme/images/lknindl.png"> Lady Ninde Amblecrown, once Waterdeep's most alluring young ingenue, now a hunted woman with a tongue like a guillotine, formidable magical skill and a matching ego. Will you befriend her? Grow to love her? Will you even be able to bring yourself to tolerate her?

She is a Neutral Evil elven necromancer and can be found in Bodhi's lair only if the PC sides with Aran Linvail. She's rated PG13, on account of some steaminess here and there. The romance boasts some more mature content.

Her lavish upbringing have perhaps left Ninde with a slightly bloated sense of entitlement that doesn't exactly suit her to adventure, and certain events of her past darkened her temperament. That's not to say Ninde doesn't appreciate life's more earthy pleasures - men, mead and magic are her self-confessed vices, and 'being poor, seal-clubbing, and chastity' the only things she isn't good at. Although perhaps she exaggerates slightly, there.

She will certainly prover herself a wily, capable and (hopefully) entertaining companion, whether trying to bed Valygar or encouraging <CHARNAME> to take a little walk on the wild side. If your lucky, you may even see a more serious face of the vivacious elf.

Whether Ninde is truly a woman altered beyond repair by the blackening tint of her past, or the proverbial tart with a heart - well, that's for you to decide.

Ninde also aims to expand upon the background of a certain character who remains, in the vanilla game, virtually unexplained; Lassal. Through a romance or friendship with Ninde, the player can uncover more of his shady story as well as that of Ninde herself.

**Content:**
- A unique romance for a male PC of any race with a charisma of 13+ spanning SoA & ToB.
- A friendship track for female PCs.
- Reactive ToB dialogues depending on your decisions in SoA.
- Original portrait art by wonnimchunha.
- Original music by theacefes.
- A challenging new encounter in Athkatla.
- Extensive interaction with all the Bioware NPCs, and juicy new dialogue with Lassal, Bodhi, and Aran Linvail.
- A distinctive, vocal and only slightly irritating new companion for the more masochistic Bhaalspawn.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

Ninde NPC is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/417-ninde/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Although it is not required for Ninde NPC to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>


<hr>


## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-ninde.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **ninde** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Ninde NPC for BGII for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: ninde folder and a setup-ninde.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-ninde.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-ninde.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Ninde NPC for BGII for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: ninde folder, setup-ninde and setup-ninde.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-ninde.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-ninde.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Ninde NPC for BGII for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-ninde`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-ninde --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="details" id="details"></a>Details

#### Statistics

- Strength 9 (*Fairly average; Ninde has never experienced hard labour or wielded anything heavier then a staff.*)
- Dexterity 15 (*Natural elfin grace plus a childhood filled with dance classes.*)
- Constitution 10 (*Again, average. She takes care of herself, but isn't precisely stout.*)
- Intelligence 16 (*Expensive, expansive formal education and a generally quick mind.*)
- Wisdom 16 (*She's seen the world, and lived in it. Perhaps a little too much.*)
- Charisma 15 (*Vivacious and assertive with an elegant turn of phrase.*)

## 

#### Biography

> "*The past is precisely that - the past.*" Ninde says, with a pointed yawn. Despite her initial reluctance, you soon manage to glean a little more information about the sun elf's past. Namely that although she was born in the Elven forest of Cormanthor, she was raised in Waterdeep, by a wealthy family of human traders, who spared no expense on her magical education. But although she developed a taste for the finer things in life, she was distinctly less delighted by the prospect of having to work for them To her adoptive families chagrin, she fell in with the city's seedier element, and began to delve into the shadier side of arcane lore. Soon she went from Waterdhavian high society's most desirable young ingenue to a regular among the ghosts and rats of its criminal underbelly. And indeed, whatever secrets she unearthed there have left their mark on the elf. Her eyes tell you more of the tragedy, darkness, and romance of her past then the secretive Ninde herself ever would.

## <a name="romance" id="romance"></a>Romance

#### Requirements

- **Gender:** Ninde will only romance a male protagonist.
- **Race:** No restrictions.
- **Alignment:** No restrictions.
- **Class restrictions:** No restrictions.
- **Stat restrictions:** CHR 13+.

## 

#### Notes

- The romance should begin shortly after arriving in Brynnlaw if these requirements are met, and love talks will occur in Spellhold and the Underdark.
- Ninde isn't as prissy as some of your romance options. She won't end the relationship just because you say the wrong thing - in fact, she rather likes a man who'll stand up for himself. The choices that will end the romance are fairly obvious - as long as you let Ninde say her piece, and aren't too horrible to her, you should be alright.
- Ninde will be abducted, as per usual, but will NOT be vampirised - you should be able to find her easily enough.
- If you haven't had a love talk for a little while, try moving on to another area. There are a few instances where the romance won't progress until you've reached a certain point.
- Flirting should be available as soon as you get Ninde in your party, if you meet the romance conditions. She won't take kindly to certain behaviors, however. More flirts should appear as the romance progresses.
